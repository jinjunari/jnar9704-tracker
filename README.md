The Development Process
Decided to scrap the menu on the navigation bar as I felt like it was unnecessary when everything was on one page anyway.
Decided to add some placeholder text in the form for an easier user experience.
Found it challenging to make the booklist table responsive for very small screens. The only way I can think of making the table work on a small screen (without splitting the structure) was to make users scroll horizontally.
Struggled to add images for the book cover in the sample book data in the book list table. For now, I've left it as null.
Moving Forwards - Recommendations and Improvements
Consider integrating book APIs so that users do not need to manually input a book cover.
Consider adding a smooth dropdown transition for the book review section.
Make the webpage, especially the booklist table section, more seamlessly responsive for smaller screens.
