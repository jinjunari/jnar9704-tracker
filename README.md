The configuration could include information about what screen dimensions and resolutions are best for viewing your application. It should also include any extra information about interacting with your application, for example if there are any steps required to set up use of an API.

Deployment procedures is referring to any steps we need to complete in order to run your web application. For example, do we need to run 'npm install' to download the dependencies. Then which command should we use to start the server, likely either 'npm run dev' or 'npm run start'.

2.'npm run start'

_________THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:_________
-Decided to scrap the menu on the navigation bar as I felt like it was unnecessary when everything was on one page anyway.
-Decided to add some placeholder text in the form for an easier user experience.  

-I found it challenging to make the booklist table be responsive for very small screens. The only way I can think of making the table work on a small screen (without splitting the structure) was to make users scroll horizontally.

-I struggled to put an image for the book cover for the sample Book Data ;-;

_________MOVING FORWARDS- Recommentations and Improvements:_________
-Consider integrating book API's so that users do not need to manually input a book cover.
